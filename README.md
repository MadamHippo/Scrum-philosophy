# Scrum-philosophy for software development...

I really like this concept of scrum because it applies a lot to life, not just professional development. Here are the notes from the official scrum guide:

~ Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

~ Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.

~ Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

Note how people often grow, change, and develop just like a software life cycle. We must be transparent with ourselves. We must be instrospective with this transparent nature. With that honest inspection, we can adaptat our behavior as empowered people who are willing and able to change. 

*Your end goal and which behavior you would like to minic here is core to being honest with yourself. You have to answer *WHY* you would like to adaptat which starts off the cycle again by being transparent with yourself.
